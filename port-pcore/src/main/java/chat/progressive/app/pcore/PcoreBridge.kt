 * Phase-0.5 surface scan (docs/PCORE_PHASE05_TOP5.md): the top-5 room-seam
 * files reference **93 distinct org.matrix.android.sdk classes**. Bulk of
 * them are DATA MODELS (Message*Content, RoomSummary, Event, Membership,
 * ChangeMembershipState…) — these will be mirrored as plain Kotlin data
 * classes inside this module (bridge DTOs), generated mechanically from the
 * SDK sources in Phase 2 to avoid 90+ hand-written files.
 *
 * Behavioural seam shrinks to a handful of suspend calls:
 *   session scope : login/tokenRestore/syncOnce/observeState
 *   room scope    : timeline(room,batch) / sendText / redact / react /
 *                   setReadMarkers / membership ops
 *   crypto scope  : verify/backup (Phase 5)
 *   media scope   : upload/download (Phase 6)
